Hi! I am Fernando. 

I have been working developing on the back-end for more than 2 and a half years. Acquired and developed skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MongoDB/Mongoose, Node/Express.js, and React/GraphQL. I have always been passionate about problem solving and goal-oriented. In Web Development, this translates to hard work, unrelenting search for solutions and creative thinking to surpass barriers and blocks. I am skillful on setting up the Front-end while most of the time I end up working on the Back-end and the connection between both. I am responsible for creating and maintaining a shipments application to create quotes and labels and connect the OMS with other fullfilment services. My objective is to create responsive, useful and friendly web applications as I continue learning how to do it more efficiently.

I am interested in projects that are both a challenge and fun. I like videogames, cats and almost every form of audiovisual entertainment.
