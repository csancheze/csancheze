Hi! I am César. I am currently a Full Stack Web Developer student. I am learning fast to become an efficient developer. I want to be able to create friendly webpages and apps that make communication processes private and easy to use for personal and professional users. I am interested in part-time jobs and freelance projects that are both a challenge and fun. I am also a Clinical Psychologist with private practice. I like videogames, cats and almost every form of audiovisual entertainment.
